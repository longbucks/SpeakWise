The definition of my audience are people who doing interviews for jobs, pitches for their business, and oratory, public speakers.

I want to create an web application that will improve individuals' ability to speak at functions such as pitches, interviews or even their daily conversations. So they will be able to upload video files to send them off for critique with rubric and be automatically graded using a Machine learning API.
